**Last Updated:** 2025-01-14 12:02 am
**Status:** ✅ Active System
**Purpose:** Enterprise-level staffing plan and comprehensive guide for expert system management (humans and AI)

---

## CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: ALWAYS TRACK EXPERTS

**MANDATORY:** After ANY expert consultation, IMMEDIATELY update this document:
- Record the review in Expert Review History
- Update expert metrics (reviews, issues found/missed, quality)
- Recalculate success rates and priorities
- Update Performance Summary tables

**Why This Matters:**
- Tracking enables data-driven expert selection
- Performance data guides hiring/firing decisions
- Continuous improvement requires accurate records
- Enterprise-level results demand accountability

**Failure to track = system failure.** Update this document immediately after each expert review session.

## QUICK START

### What Are Experts?
AI specialists with deep domain expertise who review code, plans, and documentation to ensure quality, catch issues, and provide recommendations.

### When to Use Experts?
- **Validation:** Before implementing code changes (validate plans, catch issues early)
- **Consultation:** When you need domain-specific advice (accessibility, performance, etc.)
- **Final Approval:** For critical decisions and breaking changes

### How to Call Experts?
Simply ask the AI: *"Call in [Expert Name] to review [what needs review]"*
Example: *"Call in CSS Architecture Expert to review this sidebar implementation plan"*

2. Expert with most reviews (more data = more reliable)
3. Expert with highest average quality (4.5 > 4.0 > 3.5)
4. Expert with fewest issues missed (0 > 1 > 2+)
5. Expert with fastest response time (if all else equal)

**Example:**
- CSS Architecture Expert: 100% success, 2 reviews, 4.5 quality, 0 missed → **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
